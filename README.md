## Welcome to GitHub Pages
 The problem we found for this project was, how to connect users to a search for streamers of thier chossen game from multpile platforms that provide streaming services. 
 We linked twitch and youtube to correlate with the search input from the user and the top 6 buttons from twitch.
 this relyed mainly on apis and as this is a free website there are certain limitations mainly the quotas for the api calls.
